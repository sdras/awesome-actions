## Ideas

- Stargazer Threshold action - continue through a workflow after a certain number of stars is passed (every 100 stars, every 500 stars, etc)
- Twitter Action - Tweet out content
- Iteration Manager - When issues are added to a milestone, add to an iteration plan issue in the repo automatically.
- Issue Reproducer - Set up infrastructure to try reproducing code workflows to try verifying bugs
- Image optimizer - When PRs are opened with static image assets, optimize them before merging
- Puppeteer swarm - Spin up various instances Puppeteer with different viewports and take screenshots to see previews of websites
- Lighthouse action - Setup Lighthouse tool to run website audits in CI (Not allow merges / deploys to production environments if lighthouse score drops)
